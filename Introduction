Introduction:

My name is Samantha Teten and I am from a corn and soybean farm in southeast Nebraska near the small town of Johnson. I am the 5th generation on this farm and have loved everything relating to agriculture for a long as I can remember. Since sixth grade, I knew I wanted to be an agronomist and was actively involved in 4-H and the National FFA Organization. From there, I attended the University of Nebraska - Lincoln with a major in agronomy and participated in the Crops Judging Team, Soil Judging Team, and Agronomy Club. I am now in the second year of my masters degree in the Biological Engineering Department where I am exploring precision agriculture with sensor-based nitrogen management in corn. I plan to graduate this upcoming May and pursue a career in industry. 

In my free time, I love baking (especially pies), gardening, hiking, and exploring breweries & wineries with friends. My most recent hobbies to keep me occupied during COVID-19 have been learning my grandma's accordian and flying my drone around the farm. My computing experience consists of dabbling in Python, Matlab, SAS, R, and microcontroller languages, but not fulling mastering any of them. I am excited for this class to expand my knowledge in these languages and learn some new skills in presentation and graphing strategies.
